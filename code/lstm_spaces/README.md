## Loading speaker spaces from REG models

* Running *python get_lstm_spaces.py*, *python get_captioning_space.py* only makes sense if you have access to specific REG models trained by Sina
* Running *python train_ref_cbow.py* trains simple CBOW models with gensim, on data from refcoc or Visual Genome (you need specific dataframes for that)
